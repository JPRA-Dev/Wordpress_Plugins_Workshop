# What are hooks?

They are functions declared by the theme or the plugin developer enabling us to interact with the WordPress core, themes or other plugins and call them at a certain time. 

They are two types of hooks: 
- actions: call a functions after an event 
- filters: get a value at a specific moment in order to modify it
