# Actions

Actions are used to executed custom functions after an event occurs which an action executed by the WP core. They are initialized by the do_action( 'action_name' ) function within the WordPress code.

## Actions and filters: two names, one goal ?

If you take a peek into the core, you will see that add_action is actually a wrapper function for add_filter (wp-includes/plugin.php):

```
function add_action( $hook_name, $callback, $priority = 10, $accepted_args = 1 ) {
	return add_filter( $hook_name, $callback, $priority, $accepted_args );
}
```

## Actions and callbacks: do_action() & add_action()

```
do_action('wp_head')
# creates an action hook

add_action('wp_head','custom_register')
# when do_action('wp_head') is called WP execute custom_register() as well
```
