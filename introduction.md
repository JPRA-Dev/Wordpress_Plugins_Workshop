# Introduction

When WordPress gets updated to a new version, it overrides its core files. Because of this, if you add a custom functionality to a WordPress site by directly modifying the WordPress core, your changes will be wiped out upon WordPress upgrade. This leads to one of the core WordPress development concepts â€“ any functionality you want to add or modify should be done using plugins.

A WordPress plugin is essentially one or more functions defined in PHP files, as PHP is the main scripting language powering WordPress. It also typically has 3 other components:  hooks (action hooks and filter hooks), shortcodes and widgets. These are the main elements of WordPress plugin development.
